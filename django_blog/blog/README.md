## üß© Django Blog ‚Äî User Authentication System

### üìò Overview

This section of the Django Blog Project implements a comprehensive user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, log out, and manage their profiles.
It builds upon the foundational blog setup completed in Task 1.

Django provides robust authentication and authorization mechanisms out of the box, which we leverage and extend for this project.
In this implementation, we use both Django‚Äôs built-in authentication views and custom forms and views to support user registration and profile management.

### üß† Key Concepts and Learning Points

| Concept                   | Explanation                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**        | Confirms a user‚Äôs identity (e.g., login/logout).                                                |
| **Authorization**         | Determines what a user is allowed to do (e.g., edit their own posts).                           |
| **Django Auth Framework** | Provides models, forms, and views for handling users securely.                                  |
| **User Model**            | Represents the `User` entity in Django, containing fields like `username`, `email`, `password`. |
| **UserCreationForm**      | A built-in Django form that simplifies user registration securely with password hashing.        |
| **CSRF Protection**       | Django automatically protects forms against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks using tokens.    |
| **LoginRequiredMixin**    | A class-based view mixin that restricts view access to authenticated users only.                |

### üó®Ô∏è Comment Functionality

**_What‚Äôs added:_**

`Comment` model with timestamps and link to Post and User.

`CommentForm` with validation.

`add_comment` view for creation and CBVs for update/delete.

**Templates:** embedded comment list + create form in post_detail.html; separate edit/delete templates.

### üè∑Ô∏è Tagging & Search Features

Each post can have one or more tags (e.g., django, backend, python).

Tags can be added when creating or editing a post, separated by commas.

Tags appear under each post and link to a page showing related posts.

The search bar allows searching by title, content, or tags.

Example URLs:

/tags/django/ ‚Üí all posts tagged ‚Äúdjango‚Äù
